          disable to avoid cpu usage
            * blur via settings/chatmenu, snow via debugmenu
    * forward and delete limits are raised from 100 upto 1024
        * technically forward have huge native limit, so 200+ forward via API w/o issues
        * delete have native limit 100 per request, so i slice your array with ids into chunks with
          100 ids
            * technically there are NO limit, BUT TG api have rate limits, so if you wanna delete
              8000 messages, it's 80 chunks = 80 requests, TG will probably ban you for 5-10
              minites (no more deletions during this time due you're abused API)
            * so it's a nice feature, but remember about TG's api rates

        * remote deletions via GCM pushes should to work too (i have no gapps here, but some folks
          have)
        * if chat have a timer there are no `deleted` flag, i will add it later due we know that it
          will be deleted once read (cause there are a timer :D )
    * new internal variable `DUROV_RELOGIN`=`1` and a table

          regisration/login, due we just say "yes"/`true`
    * due app is from github official "check update" disabled, so app will not ask TG servers if
      there are new one.
    * api keys are `4`/`014b35b6184100b085b0d0572f9b5103` due gplay/store/web versions are use them
