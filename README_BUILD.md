# Build

It's very simple

* download the repo `git clone https://github.com/nikitasius/Telegraher.git`
* build it
    * you can use official guide `https://core.telegram.org/reproducible-builds`
        * open the folder with the repo
        * git checkout lastest **noshit** branch (`git checkout remotes/origin/noshit_8.8.5` for
          example)
        * run `docker build -t telegram-build .`
        * run `docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/home/source telegram-build`
            * and ~1h later you will get 9 different builds (under deb11 with 12 cores and 16Gb Ram
              on NVMe)
    * you can download Android studio `https://developer.android.com/studio`
        * add a bit more ram (i use 4096M for the studio)
        * open the project
        * let gradle it work
        * when it's done go to Build -> Select build variant
            * choose build you need
                * afatDebug - it's debug builds
                * ***Release - release builds
