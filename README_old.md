## Telegraher

* **No one gets to decide** what i run on my device
* **No one gets to decide** where i run my app
* **No one gets to decide** what must be deleted

This is my device so i control it 😎

This app have nothing with privacy, it's remotely controlled. It's pissing me off, so i changed
that.

I took an original Telegram client from ["official" repo](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram) and
made my own theme park with blackjack and hoookers.

Special thanks:

* my wife and my dog, love them 🍑
* mr Rodríguez for the inspiration
* some anonymous folks over the telegram for the great ideas (can't share their names here, cause
  they are anonymous)
* "Telegram🦄magic🦄team" for their "magic🦄updates" including ~~private~~ chats and "magic🦄ads"

### WTF?! / is it legit?

Follow the ~~white rabbit~~ the git flow:

* i took and forked the original client
* i cloned the latest `master` branch (with 8.3.1 patch) into `master_8.3.1`
* i made another branch `noshit_8.3.1` from `master_8.3.1`, it contain changes

It gives us `telegram` -> `master` -> `master_8.3.1` -> `noshit_8.3.1`

So **all the code changes** are in `noshit_8.3.1` (when this project started, actual version is
different)

### Detailed summary / noshit_8.7.4

* DISABLED ADS
    * YES!!1
    * no more sponsored messages, we still download them but do not display
        * we still count views for this ADS to hide our behavior of the app "who don't earn money
          for TG"
* EVERY element have `save to downloads`/`save to gallery`
    * ~~messages are elements too, you still can click but cannot save them into downloads~~ fixed
        * ~~however i do not recomment this~~
    * use it wisely
* ~~6 accounts instead of 3~~ ~~32~~ ~~128~~ 80 accounts
    * to enbale more than 3 you need to activate "3+" option
    * ~~client support upto 6 accounts~~
        * ~~on the 1st run when you type phone number and continue it can throw an API error~~
            * ~~error was only on the version with 16 accounts~~
                * ~~to get more accounts w/o having problems with TGs api need to change the App's
                  flow~~
            * in case of an error close the error by clicking OK and let it relax for 5 minutes
            * continue and log in
* DISABLED REMOTE DELETIONS
    * NO more deletions via GCM PUSHES (chats and messages), WTF 💩
    * NO more deletions in groups and channels
        * i hate the channels that wipes the content
    * NO more remote deletions in private chats
    * NO more remote deletions in secret chats
        * self destruction timer doesn't work but other folks see that you're opened and deleted it
    * NO more "history wipe" or chat deletions
        * history/messages remains where they are
        * chat becomes inactive if other folks are deleted it for them and/or for you
* FULL ACCESS in "restrict saving content" chats
    * screenshots, gif imports, media saving
    * DO NOT save GIFS via saving gifs
        * just click on them and choose "save to gallery"
        * after this share this media no matter where as a video file **WITHOUT** sound
        * it will become a GIF in your collection
    * you **can't forward** message as is due it use **telegram API** and their server will block
      it, so save/copy
        * save GIF / forward message ARE using telegrams API, while SHARING or DOWNLOADING not
* FULL ACCESS in secret chats (GREEN ONES!)
    * you can download any medias and documents
    * you can take screenshots or record your screen
        * WTF apple can do that, we can do it too!
* GIFs have controls
    * you can start/stop GIFs or navigate on a timeline
* KEEP CACHED chats
    * cached chats are always with you even if you're BANNED (
        * once banned you will get a message about this
        * you can navigate in chat where you was banned using your cache
        * to remove cached chat you must delete it ("leave that chat")
    * even when when you restart your app it will load cached chats
* HISTORY in private chats
    * message separated inside by RFC1123 timestamp field
    * when someone will send you a PM and will change it, while you in chat you will see `edited` as
      usual
        * to see changes you need to **close/open** this **chat**
            * this will be probably fixed in future (display in real time changes)
    * this also affect bots, so when your bots edit their messages, you will see old/new versions
* NO MORE timer
    * when someone send you a media with a timer in a secret (green) chat this message will be
      deleted on a device who sent it once you open it
    * when someone send you a media with a timer in a private (NON-green) chat this message will be
      deleted on a device who sent it once OR twice you open it
        * EASY AND SHORT: open photo twice and it will WIPE it from a device who sent it ;-)
        * LONG AND DETAILED: due it will send an event only if full file is downloaded by your
          client when you open this (guess due file size). In most of cases client download media
          file during 1st open, so you need to open it again (just tap on it)
        * sometimes full media downloaded when preview generated, in such case open once file and it
          will wipe it from a user who sent it
* ~~SNOW & BLUR~~
    * ~~they are added back into debug menu (when you press version 2 times)~~
    * since 8.5.0 doesn't work cause TG devs are fuckedup this part (rendering)
        * if you had enable snow/blur please disable them temporary in menu to avoid and CPU usage
* SHADOWBAN feature! block anyone just for you! Shadowban settings works for messages in group chats
    * if you shadowban (SB) an user you will not see his messages
    * if you SB a group you will not see anonymous admin messages
    * if you SB a channel, you will not see messages in chat made by the users who user channels to
      hide their IDs nor messages in these channels (but you will see automatic reposts in channel
      linked with the group, this moment i will fix later for better SB:) )
* You can DISABLE doubletap (=quick) reactions
    * open quick reactions
    * select already selected reaction one more time
    * checkbox will disappear, double tap reactions are disabled.
* NO MORE `edit_hide`
    * telegram can send you messages with `edit_hide==true` to hide what this message has been
      edited
    * now if message contains signs of editions it will marked
* DISABLED emulator detections
    * idk why the client use this, but i disabled it
    * if i want to run it on emulator telegram no need to know it
* LEGIT Phone
    * for the app and TG you have simcard, sim is online, phone is actual
        * app don't check it anymore, it's disabled
* Hi, i'm Vanilla 💅
    * we use actual sha256 fingerprint from vanilla version 8.4.4
    * we say we're `org.telegram.messenger`
    * we say Google installed us `com.android.vending`
* APP name changed & APP icon changed & APP package changed
    * of you want to run using old name just rollback those commits and build the app
* APPs api & hash are changed for legit TG client
    * actually they are all on `4`/`014b35b6184100b085b0d0572f9b5103`
* Left-side menu changed, not it's display the username (if exists) and the list of accounts have
  phonenumber added here
* KABOOM, new features in Storage management, which allow you to wipe the app's data (include the
  accs, confirmation is required) from the Srttings/Data/Storage or from Android's app menu/Storage
  management
* Device spoofing
* Our menu NOW near the Kaboom button (but you can bring it back!)
* Admins now can delete all own messages in a group chat
* Check our menu cause this list is a bit outdated ^^
* Bring it back and there are no vanilla links. ~~APP do not manage APKs anymore~~
    * because some folks have issues to install APKs from TG fork on Android10 and/or MIUI
        * ~~before it have a code and required install pkg permissions~~
            * ~~thats why w/o permission TG displayed an error that there are no tool in system to
              install APKs~~

        * technically forward have huge native limit, so 200+ forward via API w/o issues
        * delete have native limit 100 per request, so i slice your array with ids into chunks with
          100 ids
            * technically there are NO limit, BUT TG api have rate limits, so if you wanna delete
              8000 messages, it's 80 chunks = 80 requests, TG will probably ban you for 5-10
              minites (no more deletions during this time due you're abused API)
            * so it's a nice feature, but remember about TG's api rates
* noshit_8.5.0_release1
    * updated to TG 8.5.0
    * fixed issue #7
    * fixed issue with ffmpeg
      lib ([301601](https://github.com/nikitasius/Telegraher/commit/3016016c51ce8ce530bd7a9566c53e9fbb68ada2)
    * blur & snow doesn't work cause TG devs are fucked it up
        * if you had blur/snow enabled please disable it to avoid CPU usage
* noshit_8.4.4_release2
    * added `delete` mark
        * when someone wiped messages OR history you will see it, just need to close/open an actual
          chat
        * `deleted` will me marked on the place of `edited`
        * remote deletions via GCM pushes should to work too (i have no gapps here, but some folks
          have)
        * if chat have a timer there are no `deleted` flag, i will add it later due we know that it
          will be deleted once read (cause there are a timer :D )
    * new internal variable `DUROV_RELOGIN`=`1` and a table
        * here we store level of our changes, due we added new column `isdel` into `messages_v2`
          table and made a new table `telegraher_init`
        * i used vanilla code to apply DB update (same what TG use when you see "hi, tg updating
          database etc")
    * fixed an issue #6
        * when we wiped remote chats they aren't wiped so not they are wiped

    * you can enable/change/disable double tab reactions (=quick reactions)
        * vanilla client offer only change them :)
* noshit_8.4.3_release2
    * we use now fingerprint, package name and referer (who installed us, i.e. Google Play) from a
      vanilla version
    * APP lost few permission due it not need it anymore
        * app do not check number, sim state or is number is the actual you use on
          regisration/login, due we just say "yes"/`true`
    * due app is from github official "check update" disabled, so app will not ask TG servers if
      there are new one.
    * api keys are `4`/`014b35b6184100b085b0d0572f9b5103` due gplay/store/web versions are use them
* noshit_8.4.3_release1
    * update to 8.4.3
    * disabled access to all reactions
        * since TG again moderate/censor your private (non-green) chats you can't use them anymore,
          because server simply ignores it and reject w/ an error.
